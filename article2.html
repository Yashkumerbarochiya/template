				Wondering how to use DALL·E 2? OpenAI's AI art generator remains one of the best know, and it allows anyone to generate images of practically anything by writing a text description. In theory, that is, because it takes a little bit of trial and error - or a few pointers, to learn how to use DALL·E 2 effectively
<br>
<br>
				As with all AI art generators, the tool is controversial due to fears of potential misuse and a questionable approach to copyright on the billions of images that were used to train the model. Nevertheless, many artists and designers are exploring how to use DALL·E 2 in their workflows.
				<br>
<br>
				DALL·E 2 is high up in our list of the best AI art generators thanks to its clean, intuitive interface and ease of use. You go to the website, create an account and you can generate images of anything you can imagine by typing out a text prompt. There are a few things to bear in mind, however. Below, we'll explain how to access DALL·E 2, how to use DALL·E 2 successfully and a few tips on how to make DALL·E 2 images better. 
			</p>
			<p>
				DALL·E 2 is a browser-based tool (it also offers an API that developers can use in their own apps). To use it online, you'll need to create an account. This is a quick process and once you've confirmed your email or telephone number, you can get started straight away. All users get 50 free credits to start with, enough to explore how the tool works. You get another 15 free credits each month, but if you end up using the tool regularly, you'll eventually need to buy more (see below for more on the pricing).
				<br>
				<br>
				When you access DALL-E 2 via the website, you'll find It's fairly intuitive. Type in a description of what you want in the text box, for example 'an astronaut riding a horse in an impressionist style'. Click 'generate' and DALL·E will create four 1024x1024 images based on what you wrote.
				<br>
<br>
				You can tweak your prompt until you get a result you're happy with, and then click on the one you like. On the next screen you can download the image (click the arrow in the top right of the image). You can also edit the image (click 'edit'; and you'll get tools such as an eraser and options to upload an image to add to the AI creation or to add more squares to expand your image). You can also create 'variations' of the image – DALL-E 2 will create 4 alternative version of the image you created.

			<h2 class="display-7 secondfont mb-3 font-weight-bold">How to improve DALL·E 2 images</h2>
			<p>
				It's unlikely that DALL·E 2 is going to give you the results you want the first time. You might have to edit images by writing new prompts for specific elements within them. And there are somethings that may just be impossible to correct in DALL·E 2. 
				<br>
				<br>
				There may be unwanted artefacts in images, and, like all AI art generators, DALL·E 2 can struggle with human faces and bodies. To improve images created in DALL·E 2 you may need to export them and then edit them in more traditional image editing software like Photoshop. For example, you can fix wonky eyes, using Photoshop's Neural Filters.
				<br>
<br>
				DALL·E 2 also has a limit on resolution, which means it isn't possible to create images that are big enough to print at large sizes, but you may have success upscaling your image in another program. See below for more common questions about DALL·E 2.
			</p>

			<h2 class="display-7 secondfont mb-3 font-weight-bold">How can I make my DALL·E 2 images better?</h2>

			<p>
				If your DALL-E 2 images aren't turning out how you'd like there are a few things you could bear in mind. Ensure your prompt is a detailed as possible – including detail about the background if that's important. Specify the style of art you want if you're going for an artistic style, or specify camera angles, lighting details, focal distance and even the specific camera if you're aiming for a photographic style. 
				<br>
				<br>
				DALL-E 2 struggles with requests for images of multiple subjects, so if possible keep it to one subject. That can be limiting, but if you want to create images with multiple subjects, you could try creating separate images and then editing them together. Remember that you can edit images in Dall-E 2 or alternatively export them to edit in the best photo editing software.
